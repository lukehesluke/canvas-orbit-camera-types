# canvas-orbit-camera-types

TypeScript types for [orbit-camera](https://github.com/mikolalysenko/orbit-camera) and [canvas-orbit-camera](https://github.com/hughsk/canvas-orbit-camera).

Eventually, I'll open a PR in [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped) so that they can be installed with:

```
npm install --save @types/orbit-camera
npm install --save @types/canvas-orbit-camera
```
